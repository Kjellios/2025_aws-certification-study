# AWS + HashiCorp Certification Study Repo

This repository documents my intensive certification study path.  
It contains notes, labs, wrong-answer logs, practice scores, and progress trackers for AWS and HashiCorp certifications.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Pass multiple certifications in 12 months using an intensive cadence (25â€“30h/week).
- Start with **AWS Solutions Architect â€“ Associate (SAA-C03)** and chain vouchers into harder exams.
- Reinforce knowledge through hands-on labs and public documentation.

## ðŸ“… Exam Roadmap
1. SAA-C03 (Solutions Architect â€“ Associate)
2. SCS-C02 (Security Specialty)
3. Terraform Associate (003)
4. SAP-C02 (Solutions Architect â€“ Professional)
5. ANS-C01 (Advanced Networking Specialty)
6. DAS-C01 (Data Analytics Specialty)

## ðŸ›  Using Templates

- **When you watch videos â†’** copy `template/notes/TEMPLATE-notes.md` into the current examâ€™s `notes/` folder and fill it in.  
- **When you do a lab â†’** copy `template/labs/TEMPLATE-lab.md` into the current examâ€™s `labs/` folder.  
- **When you miss a question â†’** copy `template/wrong-answers/TEMPLATE-wrong-answer-log.md` into the current examâ€™s `wrong-answers/` folder for that week.  
- **Artifacts** (diagrams, screenshots) go into `artifacts/`.

This keeps every file consistent across phases.

## âš¡ Workflow
- **Daily:** Watch videos â†’ do labs â†’ log wrong answers â†’ push commit.
- **Weekly:** Update progress tracker, review weak areas.
- **Commit messages:**  
  ```
  [SAA Week1-Day1] IAM role lab + 25Q quiz logged
  ```
- **Security:** `.gitignore` excludes credentials, `.tfstate`, `.env`. Never commit secrets.
