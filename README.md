# AWS + HashiCorp Certification Study Repo

This repository documents my intensive certification study path.  
It contains notes, labs, wrong-answer logs, practice scores, and progress trackers for AWS and HashiCorp certifications.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Pass multiple certifications in 12 months using an intensive cadence (25â€“30h/week).
- Start with **AWS Solutions Architect â€“ Associate (SAA-C03)** and chain vouchers into harder exams.
- Reinforce knowledge through hands-on labs and public documentation.

## ðŸ“… Exam Roadmap
1. SAA-C03 (Solutions Architect â€“ Associate)
2. SCS-C02 (Security Specialty)
3. Terraform Associate (003)
4. SAP-C02 (Solutions Architect â€“ Professional)
5. ANS-C01 (Advanced Networking Specialty)
6. DAS-C01 (Data Analytics Specialty)
